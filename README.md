# KristChat - Early Development

KristChat is a social media platform concept that takes advantage of transaction metadata on the Krist blockchain, built for ComputerCraft. Create posts or right click on other posts to attach the content of that post to your message and create a cascading rainbow!

KristChat as a whole is in a very early stage of development. Do not expect a flawless experience, or even a very good one. Do give me feedback through the issues tab on this GitHub repo. 

## Install

Development for KristChat has been done primarily on [CraftOS-PC 2](https://github.com/MCJack123/craftos2). KristChat is a lot more usable of an application when in an emulator on a bigger screen. Download CraftOS-PC2 [here](https://www.craftos-pc.cc/).

To install, run:
```
    pastebin run e7sQBHAT
```
To start the client, run the program `kchat`

If you would like to change any of the config, like enabling dark mode, run `edit .kconfig`

## Features

Features currently provided (either in part or fully):
- Posting/Re-Posting of messages
- In-app post loading - The latest posts are collected while you browse and viewable at the click of a button
- Self profiles - View your interactions through all of KristChat
- Multi-address support - Quickly log into an alt account
- Multi-channel support - Use krist "names" to quickly navigate through topics/communities

Features to be added in the coming days/weeks:
- Tip other users - Incentivize making good posts
- Nicknaming - Change all mention of an address to a familiar username
- Friends - Quickly access another users self profile

## Channels

On logging in/creating an address, 2 channels are automatically added. `allchat.kst`, and `self`. The `self` channel is going to be where all of your interactions go - For now, it's a bit of a desolate place, containing only messages you explicity put there. `allchat.kst` is the free public chat. All messages sent to this channel will be automatically refunded, as best as possible. 

You are welcome to create your own channels/topics, but I (hugeblank) am not liable for any loss of krist due to a failure of the address to refund users.

## Early Dev Faucet

KristChat leverages Krist's blockchain, meaning that in order to post, you have to have obtained Krist, either through mining or transactions. Since I know that this may be a caveat to incoming users that are entirely unfamiliar with Krist, I will provide 5KST to verifiably new accounts in a manual process. Please Add @hugeblank#4114 as a friend on discord if you're in need of some Krist to start posting.

Happy Chatting!
